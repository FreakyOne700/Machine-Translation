# 🧠 Machine-Translation

A multilingual machine translation system built from scratch using custom datasets, tokenizers, and models. The goal is to build a flexible and modular translation pipeline that can be easily extended to new languages and models.

## 🔧 Features

- Multilingual support (e.g., English ↔ French, English ↔ Spanish)  
- Custom tokenizer training (SentencePiece or other)  
- Clean dataset preprocessing pipeline  
- Modular, customizable model architecture  
- Easy integration and extension


## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- PyTorch or TensorFlow  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- SentencePiece  
- Jupyter Notebook

  
## 🚀 Getting Started
- Create Dataset
Open Create_Dataset.ipynb and generate your parallel corpora.
- Tokenizer Training
Use scripts under Tokenizer/ to train or load your tokenizer.
- Model Training
Modify and run training scripts inside the Model/ directory.
- Evaluation
Evaluate translation quality using BLEU, ROUGE, or other metrics.



**Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
